Known issues 
------------

1. At certain height, there is no seamless transition. object movement distortion
2. In overlapping region, for gradual slant blending, object at certain height are doubled.


Try-outs 
--------

Camera calibration  - created a dataset with 10x7 checker board.
		      Images captured at different angle
		    Result - fetched camera matrix distortion coeff and reprojection error data. 
			     undistort the video frames using that data. 
			     Faced alignment issues and frames are distorted at the corners.


Stitching - Given input a specific region of intrest from the two images (ie overlaping region)
		Used orb detector to find the keypoints (edges,line intesections)
		USed Bf matcher to match the key points from both region of intrest
		Found homography matrix according to the matching points
		Warped the two images according to the matrix found
